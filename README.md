# StockPricePredictor

LSTM, GRU and RNN models were trained to forecast an equity's future closing price. The model was trained using 36 years' worth of normazlied historical data on equities from the New York Stock Exchange. An equity's simple and exponential moving averages were calculated and used as features for models. The most accurate model (GRU) achieved a mean square error of 0.000018 when predicting the future closing price of an equity.
